== Download ==

Download a file from rapidshare:

{{{
plowdown http://rapidshare.com/files/123123123/a.jpg
}}}

Download a list of files (one link per line):

{{{
plowdown file_with_links.txt
}}}

Download a file from megaupload using a free membership account:

{{{
plowdown -a myuser:mypassword http://www.megaupload.com/?d=132348234
}}}

A more complex example for advanced users: you have a found a webpage containing a bunch of megaupload files and want to download, let's say, the first ten links. You could then write:

{{{
curl http://some-website.com/page.html | \
    grep -o "http://www.megaupload.com/[^\"< ]*" | head -n10 | plowdown -
}}}

== Upload ==

Upload a file to megaupload using a free membership:

{{{
plowup megaupload -- -a myuser:mypassword -d "My description" myfile.txt
}}}

Upload a file to rapidshare using the free-zone user:

{{{
plowup rapidshare -- -a myuser:mypassword myfile.txt
}}}

= Create new modules =

_Plowshare_ is designed with modularity in mind, so it should be easy to create new  modules. Study the code any of the existing modules (for example, [http://code.google.com/p/plowshare/source/browse/trunk/src/modules/2shared.sh 2shared]) and create you own. 

New modules will be added to _plowshare_ as long as they are released under a GNU GPL v3 compatible license.
