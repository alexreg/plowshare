= Usage examples =

== Download ==

  * Download a file from rapidshare:

{{{
$ plowdown http://www.rapidshare.com/files/86545320/Tux-Trainer_25-01-2008.rar
}}}

  * Download a file from rapidshare with a proxy. _curl_ supports `http_proxy` environment variable (notice that 3128 is the default port).

{{{
$ export http_proxy=http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:80
$ plowdown http://www.rapidshare.com/files/86545320/Tux-Trainer_25-01-2008.rar
}}}

  * Download a list of links (one link per line):

{{{
$ plowdown file_with_links.txt
}}}

  * Download a list of links (one link per line) commenting out (with #) those successfully downloaded:

{{{
$ plowdown -m file_with_links.txt
}}}

  * Limit the download rate to give your bandwidth a break (you can use _curl_ rates: K=Kbps, M=Mbps, G=Gbps):

{{{
$ plowdown -r 50K http://www.rapidshare.com/files/86545320/Tux-Trainer_25-01-2008.rar
}}}

  * Download a file from megaupload using a free membership account:

{{{
$ plowdown -a myuser:mypassword http://www.megaupload.com/?d=132348234
}}}

  * Download a password-protected file from megaupload:

{{{
$ plowdown -p somepassword http://www.megaupload.com/?d=ieo1g52v
}}}

  * Use a different web retriever for the last file download. File URL, file name and cookies are available through interpolations. Let's say you want to use _wget_:

{{{
$ plowdown --run-download='wget -O "%filename" --load-cookies "%cookies" "%url"' http://www.2shared.com/file/4446939/c9fd70d6/Test.html
}}}

  * Filter alive links in a text file

{{{
$ plowdown -c file_with_links.txt > file_with_active_links.txt
}}}

  * Safe download. Each URL will be limited in the number of tries (mainly for captchas) and wait delays. Add this alias in your _~/.bashrc_.
{{{
$ alias plowdown='plowdown --max-retries=20 --timeout=3600'
$ plowdown --mark-downloaded file_with_links.txt
}}}

== Upload ==

  * Upload a file to megaupload with a free membership account:

{{{
$ plowup -a myuser:mypassword -d "My description" /path/myfile.txt megaupload
}}}

  * Upload a file to megaupload with a premium account and multifetch upload:

{{{
$ plowup -a myuser:mypassword -d "My description" --multifetch http://www.somewherefarbeyond.com/somefile megaupload
}}}

  * Upload a file to rapidshare anonymously changing uploaded file name:

{{{
$ plowup /path/myfile.txt rapidshare:anothername.txt
}}}

== Delete ==

  * Delete a file from megaupload (a free or premium account is required):

{{{
$ plowdel -a myuser:mypassword http://www.megaupload.com/?d=132348234
}}}


= Implement your own modules =

_Plowshare_ is designed with modularity in mind, so it sh ould be easy to create new  modules. Study the code of any of the existing modules (for example, [http://code.google.com/p/plowshare/source/browse/tags/RELEASE-LAST/src/modules/2shared.sh 2shared]) and create you own. New modules will be added to _plowshare_ as long as they are released under a GNU GPL compatible license.

= Feedback =

If you find a bug in plowshare or want to propose an enhancement open a new [http://code.google.com/p/plowshare/issues/ issue]. For other comments, suggestions, whatever, you can email me: tokland AT gmail.com.

== Request for new modules ==

Plowshare has reached a pretty mature state, and I am fairly satisfied with what it currently does. However, there are dozens of file-sharing websites out there, and naturally users ask for their favorite to be implemented. As you can easily understand, I don't have the time to add support for every one of these websites, so I've decided to establish a quid-pro-quo agreement with plowshare users: if you send me a book/comic -- any language, second hand, something you liked, please ;-) -- I will implement (download only) your favorite website. If you cannot afford to send a book, a postcard would be also ok. Contact me for further information.
