= Usage =

== Download ==

  * Download a file from rapidshare:

{{{
$ plowdown http://www.rapidshare.com/files/86545320/Tux-Trainer_25-01-2008.rar
}}}

  * Download a list of files (one link per line):

{{{
$ plowdown file_with_links.txt
}}}

  * Download a file from megaupload using a free membership account:

{{{
$ plowdown -a myuser:mypassword http://www.megaupload.com/?d=132348234
}}}

  * Download a password-protected file from megaupload:

{{{
$ plowdown -p somepassword http://www.megaupload.com/?d=ieo1g52v
}}}

  * Get the file URL of a 2shared link without download the file to use your favorite downloader:

{{{
$ plowdown --link-only http://www.2shared.com/file/4446939/c9fd70d6/Test.html | xargs -rt wget
}}}

  * A more complex example for advanced users: you have a found a webpage containing a bunch of megaupload files and want to download, let's say, the first ten links. You could then write:

{{{
$ curl http://some-website.com/page.html | \
    grep -o "http://www.megaupload.com/[^\"< ]*" | head -n10 | plowdown -
}}}

== Upload ==

  * Upload a file to megaupload with a free membership account:

{{{
$ plowup -a myuser:mypassword -d "My description" megaupload:/path/myfile.txt
}}}

  * Upload a file to rapidshare anonymously:

{{{
$ plowup rapidshare:/path/myfile.txt
}}}

= Uninstall =

{{{
$ cd plowshare-VERSION
$ bash setup.sh uninstall
}}}

= Create new modules =

_Plowshare_ is designed with modularity in mind, so it should be easy to create new  modules. Study the code of any of the existing modules (for example, [http://code.google.com/p/plowshare/source/browse/tags/RELEASE-LAST/src/modules/2shared.sh 2shared]) and create you own. 

New modules will be added to _plowshare_ as long as they are released under a GNU GPL v3 compatible license.
