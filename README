= Download & Install =

  * [http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=24601 Archlinux]:

{{{
$ yaourt -Sy plowshare
}}}

  * [http://packages.gentoo.org/package/net-misc/plowshare Gentoo]:

{{{
$ emerge -av plowshare
}}}

  * [http://code.google.com/p/plowshare/downloads/list From sources]:

{{{
$ wget http://plowshare.googlecode.com/files/plowshare-VERSION.tgz
$ tar xvzf plowshare-VERSION.tgz
$ cd plowshare-VERSION
$ sudo bash setup.sh install
}}}

= Usage examples =

== Download ==

  * Download a file from rapidshare:

{{{
$ plowdown http://www.rapidshare.com/files/86545320/Tux-Trainer_25-01-2008.rar
}}}

  * Download a list of files (one link per line):

{{{
$ plowdown file_with_links.txt
}}}

  * Download a file from megaupload using a free membership account:

{{{
$ plowdown -a myuser:mypassword http://www.megaupload.com/?d=132348234
}}}

  * Download a password-protected file from megaupload:

{{{
$ plowdown -p somepassword http://www.megaupload.com/?d=ieo1g52v
}}}

  * Get only the file URL without actually downloading it. Very handy if you want to use another web downloader:

{{{
$ plowdown --link-only http://www.2shared.com/file/4446939/c9fd70d6/Test.html | xargs -rt wget
}}}

  * A more complex example for advanced users: you have a found a webpage containing a bunch of megaupload files and want to download, let's say, the first ten links. You could then write:

{{{
$ curl http://some-website.com/page.html | \
    grep -o "http://www.megaupload.com/[^\"< ]*" | uniq | head -n10 | plowdown -
}}}

  * Filter alive links in a text file

{{{
$ plowdown -c file_with_links.txt > file_with_active_links.txt
}}}

== Upload ==

  * Upload a file to megaupload with a free membership account:

{{{
$ plowup -a myuser:mypassword -d "My description" /path/myfile.txt megaupload
}}}

  * Upload a file to megaupload with a premium account and multifetch upload:

{{{
$ plowup -a myuser:mypassword -d "My description" --multifetch http://www.somewherefarbeyond.com/somefile megaupload
}}}

  * Upload a file to rapidshare anonymously changing uploaded file name:

{{{
$ plowup /path/myfile.txt rapidshare:anothername.txt
}}}

== Delete ==

  * Delete a file from megaupload (a free or premium account is required):

{{{
$ plowdel -a myuser:mypassword http://www.megaupload.com/?d=132348234
}}}


= Implement your own modules =

_Plowshare_ is designed with modularity in mind, so it sh ould be easy to create new  modules. Study the code of any of the existing modules (for example, [http://code.google.com/p/plowshare/source/browse/tags/RELEASE-LAST/src/modules/2shared.sh 2shared]) and create you own. New modules will be added to _plowshare_ as long as they are released under a GNU GPL compatible license.

= Feedback =

If you find a bug in plowshare or want to propose an enhancement open a new [http://code.google.com/p/plowshare/issues/ issue]. For other comments, suggestions, whatever, you can email me: tokland AT gmail.com.

== Request for new modules ==

Plowshare has reached a pretty mature state, and I am fairly satisfied with what it currently does. However, there are dozens of file-sharing websites out there, and naturally users ask for their favorite to be implemented. As you can easily understand, I don't have the time to add support for every one of these websites, so I've decided to establish a quid-pro-quo agreement with plowshare users: if you send me a book/comic -- any language, second hand, something you liked, please ;-) -- I will implement (download only) your favorite website. If you cannot afford to send a book, a postcard would be also ok. Contact me for further information.
