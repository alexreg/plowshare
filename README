== Download ==

  * Download a file from rapidshare:

{{{
plowdown http://rapidshare.com/files/123123123/a.jpg
}}}

  * Download a list of files (one link per line):

{{{
plowdown file_with_links.txt
}}}

  * Download a file from megaupload using a free membership account:

{{{
plowdown -a myuser:mypassword http://www.megaupload.com/?d=132348234
}}}

  * Download a password-protected file from megaupload:

{{{
plowdown -p somepassword http://www.megaupload.com/?d=1234556
}}}

  * Get the file URL of a 2shared link without download the file:

{{{
plowdown --link-only http://rapidshare.com/files/123123123/a.jpg
}}}

  * A more complex example for advanced users: you have a found a webpage containing a bunch of megaupload files and want to download, let's say, the first ten links. You could then write:

{{{
curl http://some-website.com/page.html | \
    grep -o "http://www.megaupload.com/[^\"< ]*" | head -n10 | plowdown -
}}}

== Upload ==

  * Upload a file to megaupload with a free membership account:

{{{
plowup -a myuser:mypassword -d "My description" megaupload:myfile.txt
}}}

  * Upload a file to rapidshare with a free-zone user:

{{{
plowup -a myuser:mypassword rapidshare:myfile.txt
}}}

= Create new modules =

_Plowshare_ is designed with modularity in mind, so it should be easy to create new  modules. Study the code any of the existing modules (for example, [http://code.google.com/p/plowshare/source/browse/trunk/src/modules/megaupload.sh megaupload]) and create you own. 

New modules will be added to _plowshare_ as long as they are released under a GNU GPL v3 compatible license.
