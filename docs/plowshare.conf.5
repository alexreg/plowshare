.SH NAME
plowshare.conf \- Configuration file for Plowshare

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Plowshare
(plowdown, plowup, plowdel or plowlist) uses a configuration file called 
.I plowshare.conf
for its initial setup. This configuration file is searched for in the following places when plowshare is started:
.PP
.RS 4
.nf
.I ~/.config/plowshare/plowshare.conf
.I /etc/plowshare.conf
.fi
.RE
.PP
.I plowshare.conf
file uses an INI-style format. It is composed of five sections which may be present in any order. Each section may contain lines of the form:
.PP
.RS 4
.nf
.B [General]
.RI "    " token " " = " " value
    ...
.B [Plowdown]
.RI "    " token " " = " " value
    ...
.B [Plowup]
.RI "    " token " " = " " value
    ...
.B [Plowdel]
.RI "    " token " " = " " value
    ...
.B [Plowlist]
.RI "    " token " " = " " value
    ...

.B # this is a comment
.fi
.RE
.PP
Notes:
.IP .
Blank lines or lines beginning with a hash character ('#') are treated as comments and ignored.
.IP .
Whitespace before and after a \fItoken\fP or \fIvalue\fP is ignored (although a \fIvalue\fP can contain whitespace within).
.IP .
Double quoting \fIvalue\fP is optional.
.PP
Valid tokens are always lowercase.
Names are long-option command-line arguments of plowshare. For example: \fItemp-directory\fP.
For modules options, tokens are prepended by module name and a slash character. For example: \fIhotfile/auth\fP (short-option are also possible here).

For values, no backslash interpretations is made. "\\t" is a regular string with two characters, it is not a tab character.

Options in general section prevail over Plow* section. Options given on the command line prevail over configuration file options.
